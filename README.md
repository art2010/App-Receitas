# Counter-Personal
Hello guys, This project started from the need of a pen in a game of Dot on the deck, with the help of my study colleague @art2010, we made this project.

## History
I'm going to talk a little more about the story behind this App.
On an ordinary day like all the others I was playing Dot with a friend (a kind of card game) and when we started the game, we had paper, but no pen, we just stood there looking at each other, as he decided to use the 2 calculators from our cell phones, that's when I had the idea of ​​creating an App to change the paper and pen, it was when I was in a class with my programming friend @art2010, I told him about it, so he wanted us to take the project off the paper, and I hope you like it, because it was our first project, and we are still beginners in programming.

## Implementations
-- Colors were added to the extent of loss of points below 50 yellow points, below 30 red points

-- Option to share the result to other apps
